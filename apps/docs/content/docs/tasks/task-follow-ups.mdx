### While a Task is Running

Send follow up messages to add context or make corrections while Terragon is working:

#### Example queued messages

<Tabs items={["Error handing", "Unit testing", "Code syntax"]}>
  <Tab value="Error handing">
    ```text
    Also make sure the API returns proper error codes
    ```
  </Tab>

<Tab value="Unit testing">```text Add unit tests for the new endpoints ```</Tab>

  <Tab value="Code syntax">
    ```text
    Use PostgreSQL instead of MySQL for the queries
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Messages queue and execute in the order they were sent after the AI agent completes its active work.

### After a Task is Complete

Once your task is finished, you can ask Terragon to create follow-up tasks for any next steps. Terragon will create sub-tasks from the current task that you can submit individually.

#### Follow-up tasks can:

- Build on the completed work
- Address code review feedback
- Add tests or documentation
- Handle edge cases discovered
- Implement related features

<Callout type="info">
  Follow-up tasks are currently only supported when using the Claude Code agent
</Callout>

#### Example follow-up tasks

<Tabs items={["Testing", "Documentation", "Code review"]}>
  <Tab value="Testing">
    ```text
    Create a follow-up task to add integration tests for the authentication changes in PR #123
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Documentation">
    ```text
    Create a follow-up task to update the API documentation to reflect the new endpoints from the previous task
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Code review">
    ```text

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
