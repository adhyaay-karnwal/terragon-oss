## What are Tasks?

Tasks are the core unit of work in Terragon:

- Each task runs in its own [sandbox](/docs/configuration/environment-setup/sandbox)
- Each task is scoped to a specific git repository and branch
- Each task is assigned to a single [agent](/docs/agent-providers)

You can think of a task as a conversation with an Agent with access to a specific repository and branch. The agent will be able to plan, edit and verify the changes it makes to the repository.

## Different ways to create a task

Tasks can be created in a few different ways:

- Run a task immediately from the dashboard
- [Schedule a task](/docs/tasks/scheduled-tasks) to run at a specific time in the future
- [Retry an existing task](/docs/tasks/retry) with a new prompt
- `@terragon-labs` in a [GitHub issue or pull request](/docs/integrations/github-integration)
- `@terragon` in a [Slack message](/docs/integrations/slack-integration)
- `terry create` via the [CLI](/docs/integrations/cli)
- An [Automation](/docs/automations) in response to a predefined event (eg. Pull Request Code Reviews, Issue Triage, etc.)
