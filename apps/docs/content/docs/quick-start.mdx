    ### Testing changes and merging your first pull request

    From [<House className="inline-block w-4 h-4 mx-1" />Home](https://www.terragonlabs.com):

    - Navigate to your task
    - Open the Code menu in the top right
    - Copy the `terry pull` command to pull your changes to your local repository. If you haven't installed [the Terry CLI](../integrations/cli), do that first.
    - Once you pull locally, you can run your build process, make any necessary tweaks, then push to your remote branch and merge your pull request

That's it! Your first task is complete and your first Terragon-generated pull request has been merged.
