### Writing Effective System Prompts

System prompts provide persistent instructions that apply to all tasks. Use them to:

- Define coding standards and conventions
- Specify preferred libraries or frameworks
- Set behavioral guidelines
- Include project-specific context

### Example System Prompts

<Tabs items={["Code Style", "Testing", "Project-Specific"]}>
  <Tab value="Code Style">
```text
Always use TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
Prefer functional components with hooks in React.
Use Tailwind CSS for styling, avoid inline styles.
Include JSDoc comments for all exported functions.
```
  </Tab>

<Tab value="Testing">
  ```text Write unit tests for all new functions using Vitest. Ensure test
  coverage remains above 80%. Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert. Mock
  external dependencies appropriately. ```
</Tab>

  <Tab value="Project-Specific">
```text
This is a Next.js 14 app using the App Router.
All API routes should validate input with Zod schemas.
Use our custom logger from @/lib/logger for debugging.
Follow our error handling patterns in @/lib/errors.
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" title="Best Practices">
  **Be Specific**: Clear, actionable instructions work best. **Keep it
  Concise**: Focus on the most important guidelines. **Update Regularly**:
  Adjust as your project evolves. **Test Your Prompts**: Verify the AI follows
  your instructions.
</Callout>

### Combining with Task Prompts

System prompts work alongside task-specific prompts:

- **System Prompt**: General guidelines that always apply
- **Task Prompt**: Specific instructions for the current task

Terragon considers both when working on your code.
