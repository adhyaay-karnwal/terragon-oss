description: Understand how Terragon's billing works and what is included in each subscription tier
---

Terragon offers flexible plans that scale with builders. This guide explains how the free trial works, what each paid plan includes, and how to manage your subscription.

## Free trial

Every user starts with a 14-day free trial to access the Terragon platform, and $10 of AI credits to use for agent tasks.

During the trial, you can explore everything available in the Core plan. When your trial is over, you'll need to upgrade to either the Core or Pro plan to continue using the Terragon platform.

If you run out of AI credits, you can purchase additional credits in increments of $20 at a time. Credits are sold at cost with no markup or fees—you pay exactly what the underlying AI provider charges. Alternatively, you can connect an existing subscription to an agent provider to power your agent tasks.

## Billing periods and invoicing

Both Core and Pro plans are billed monthly. Your billing cycle starts on the day you upgrade and renews on that same calendar day each month. Invoices and receipts are emailed to you once processed.

## Credit top-ups

In addition to your subscription, you can purchase additional platform credits to use across any agent provider. Credits will be used for agent requests when you don't have a provider account linked.

Credits can be purchased at $20 increments. By default, your balance will auto-reload when it drops below $5. You can manage this from `Settings → Billing` and disable auto-reload anytime.

Credits are separate from your subscription and provide flexibility for users who run into rate limits with their agent provider and want to try out different models or agents without managing multiple subscriptions.

## Manage billing

Billing for credits and subscriptions can be managed from `Settings → Billing` inside the Terragon dashboard.
