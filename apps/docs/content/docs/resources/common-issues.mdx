## Task Creation & Execution

### Tasks is stuck on `Waiting for a Sandbox to be Available`

This status means that you've hit a soft limit on the number of new sandboxes that can be created per user per hour. The system will start your new tasks as soon as the limit is reset typically within 5-10 minutes.

<Callout type="info">
  Tasks will automatically start once the limit is reset. You don't need to take any action.
</Callout>

### Environment Variables are not working

Changes to environment variables are only available for tasks created after the changes are made. Double check for typos in variable names, trailing spaces, and ensure the variables are saved.
