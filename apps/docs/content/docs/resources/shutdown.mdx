# Terragon is Shutting Down

After a lot of reflection, we've made the difficult decision to wind down Terragon.

We've been genuinely blown away by the support, feedback, and enthusiasm you've all shown for the product over the past few months, and we're incredibly grateful for the time you spent trying it and sharing your thoughts. Unfortunately, we weren't able to reach the level of traction needed to turn Terragon into a sustainable, long-term business.

We'll keep Terragon running until **February 9th, 2026**, so that anyone with an active subscription gets one last full month of usage.

Thank you again for being part of this journey with us, and for helping shape the product along the way. We're not sure what's next yet, but we'll keep you posted as we figure it out.

## What This Means for You
