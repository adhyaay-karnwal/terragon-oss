### When and How to Use Rover

Here are a few examples of scenarios and tasks that Rover excels at:

- Use voice to describe tasks for Rover while on your commute, then pickup where it left off when you're back at your desk
- Delegate small or medium tasks from your TODOs so you can focus on higher-priority work
- Give Rover backlog tasks that are hard to prioritize relative to other work
- Tag @rover-labs on GitHub issues to assign larger, well-scoped work to Rover
- Rover works well for exploring or prototyping ambiguous solutions iteratively. Give an ambiguous prompt to see how it approaches the problem, then use [the Retry feature](/docs/tasks/retry) to refine the task
- If you know how to do a task but want to delegate it, describe the task to Rover as if you were instructing another engineer
- Tasks that replicate existing patterns in your codebase work well. If you have an existing feature to replicate or adapt, send that task to Rover
- Give Rover tasks that can be verified with high confidence (e.g., if CI passes)
- If the task seems too large for one person, it may be too large for Rover. Consider breaking it into smaller tasks, or asking Rover to plan its own work first
