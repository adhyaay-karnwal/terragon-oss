Interact with Terragon directly from GitHub through app mentions, while Terragon handles PR creation and branch management automatically.

### GitHub App Mentions

<Callout type="info">
  To mention @terragon-labs on GitHub, you must grant Terragon access to the
  repository you're tagging it in. You can do this in Settings, the repository
  selector in the prompt box, or in Environments.
</Callout>

#### How It Works

Mention `@terragon-labs` in GitHub to create new Terragon tasks:

<Tabs items={["PR Comments", "Issue Comments", "Code Review Comments"]}>
  <Tab value="PR Comments">
    ```text 
    @terragon-labs can you fix the failing tests?
    ```
  </Tab>

<Tab value="Issue Comments">
  ```text @terragon-labs implement the feature described above ```
</Tab>

  <Tab value="Code Review Comments">
    ```text 
    @terragon-labs this method could be optimized using memoization 
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### What Happens

When you mention Terragon:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Terragon immediately reacts with a 👀 emoji to acknowledge your request
  </Step>
  <Step>A new task is created automatically</Step>
  <Step>
    Terragon receives full context about the PR/issue and your comment
  </Step>
  <Step>Work begins in an isolated sandbox</Step>
  <Step>
    You'll see the task appear in [<House className="inline-block w-4 h-4 mx-1" /> **Home**](https://www.terragonlabs.com)
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Task Creation Behavior

By default, Terragon keeps a single task per pull request or issue. Repeat mentions of `@terragon-labs` on the same thread are added as follow-up messages so the conversation history stays in one place.

If you want each mention to kick off a fresh task, enable **Create new task when @terragon-labs is tagged on GitHub** in [GitHub & Pull Request Settings](https://www.terragonlabs.com/settings/github). With this toggle on, Terragon always creates a brand-new task—complete with its own sandbox and timeline—whenever you tag the app on GitHub, even if a task already exists for that PR or issue.

<Callout type="warning">
  Separate tasks mean separate sandboxes and timelines. Enabling this setting is useful for parallel work or reviewer-specific follow-ups, but you will lose the consolidated discussion history and may need to keep an eye out for duplicated effort.
</Callout>

This preference applies to your Terragon account across every repository you have access to; it is not configurable per repo. Changing the setting does not modify any existing tasks—those continue exactly as they were when they were created.

#### Model Selection

The model selected for a github mention is selected based on the following priority:

1. Model specified in the comment (e.g., `@terragon-labs [sonnet] ...`)
2. Model configured in a "Github Mention" automation (if exists)
3. Your default model specified in [GitHub & Pull Request Settings](https://www.terragonlabs.com/settings/github).
4. The last model used in the task (If not creating a new task)
5. Your last selected model in the dashboard.

If an `@terragon-labs` mention will follow up on an existing task, the first selected model that is valid for the agent will be used. For example, if using Claude Code for a task, specifying `@terragon-labs [gpt-5.1] ...` will have no effect on the model selected.

Here's a table of how to specify the model for each agent directly in the the github mention comment:

| Agent       | Model                    | Example                                                                                            |

#### Prompt & Trigger Customizations

You can customize the prompt for a github mention using the "Github Mention" automation. Users on the pro tier can also customize and enable bots to mention @terragon-labs on GitHub to kick off tasks for them.

### How Terragon Works with GitHub

#### Automatic PR Creation

When working on a task, Terragon:

<Steps>
  <Step>Creates a new branch with your changes</Step>
  <Step>Commits with descriptive messages</Step>
  <Step>
    Opens a pull request with:
    <ul className="ml-4 list-disc space-y-1">
      <li>Comprehensive description</li>
      <li>Test plan checklist</li>
      <li>Co-author attribution to Terry</li>
      <li>Links to Terragon task</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### GitHub CLI Access

Every sandbox includes GitHub CLI, allowing Terragon to:

```bash title="GitHub CLI Examples"
# View PR details and comments
gh pr view 123 --comments

# Check issue information
gh issue view 456

# Understand repository context
gh repo view
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Custom GitHub Token**: Terragon automatically sets the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable to authenticate the `gh` CLI. If you need custom permissions you can override it by adding your own `GH_TOKEN` in [Environment Variables](/docs/configuration/environment-setup/environment-variables). Your custom token will take precedence.
</Callout>

#### Working with Issues

Reference issues in your prompts:

```text
Fix the authentication bug described in issue #234
```

Terragon will fetch issue details and link the PR appropriately.

### Quick GitHub Actions

For tasks with associated pull requests, Terragon provides quick actions directly above the prompt box to help you manage CI workflows:

#### Fix Failing CI Checks

When your PR has failing GitHub checks, a **Fix it** button appears that allows you to:

- Automatically create a follow-up message to the agent to address CI failures
- Let the agent investigate and fix the failing tests or checks
- Get your PR back to a passing state quickly

![Fix it button for failed GitHub checks](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/gh-fix-it--MWU.png)

#### Mark PR as Ready for Review

When your draft PR has all checks passing, a **Ready for review** button appears to:

- Mark your draft PR as ready for review with one click
- Signal to your team that the changes are ready for feedback
- Move your PR forward in the review process

![Ready for review button](https://cdn.terragonlabs.com/gh-ready-for-review-fi8d.png)

These actions help you move faster by reducing context switching between Terragon and GitHub.
