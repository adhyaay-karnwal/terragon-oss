## @Rover on Slack

<Callout type="info">
  To mention @Rover on Slack, you must first connect your Slack workspace in [Settings](https://www.roverlabs.com/settings/integrations).

### How It Works

Mention `@Rover` in Slack to create new Rover tasks. Rover will kick off a new task with the context of the message and respond with a link to the task created. When used in threads, rover will include the thread context as well.
