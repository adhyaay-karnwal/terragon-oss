You can find it at docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html.\n\nPython.org also offers a \"Python For Beginners\" section that's easy for beginners to use and learn, available at python.org/about/gettingstarted/.\n\n## Real Python\n\nReal Python offers Python tutorials for developers of all skill levels, Python books and courses, Python news, code examples, articles, and more. They have tutorials organized by skill level:\n\n- **Basics**: Begin your Python journey with these beginner-friendly tutorials. Learn fundamental Python concepts to kickstart your career.\n- **Advanced**: Explore advanced Python tutorials to master the Python programming language. Dive deeper into Python and enhance your coding skills.\n- **Specialized Topics**: Including GUI Programming and Game Development tutorials\n\n## Community Resources\n\nThe Python Wiki offers tutorials aimed at people with previous experience with other programming languages (C, Perl, Lisp, Visual Basic, etc.). Some notable resources mentioned include:\n\n- A beginner-friendly Python course with interactive, bite-size lessons, and over 100 challenges\n- A beginner-friendly Python tutorial that starts with the absolute basics but also covers more advanced stuff like Python software deployment\n- LabEx - Hands-on Labs - Practice Python programming with interactive exercises in a web-based coding environment\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstalling Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and UNIX distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python already installed.(no content)The official documentation includes a fairly brief tutorial that gives you basic information about the language and gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the library reference for a full description of Python's many libraries and the language reference for a complete (though somewhat dry) explanation of Python's syntax.\n\nThese resources should provide you with a comprehensive starting point for learning Python programming, whether you're a complete beginner or have experience with other programming languages."

California’s climate ‘superfund’ plan may have stalled | LAist\",\"url\":\"https://laist.com/news/climate-environment/california-climate-superfund-plan-may-have-stalled\"}]\n\nHere are the latest climate change news stories:\n\n## Recent Climate News Headlines\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has told the BBC people should \"stop whining\" about US President Donald Trump's approach to climate change, speaking at the Austrian World Summit organized by his Climate Initiative.\n\nNASA scientists are in a state of anxious limbo after the Trump administration proposed a budget that would eliminate one of the United States' top climate labs – the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, or GISS – as a standalone entity. The lab, founded in 1961, is still known worldwide for its computer modeling of the planet that enable scientists to make projections for how climate change may affect global temperatures, precipitation, extreme weather events and other variables.\n\nEarth's atmosphere now has more carbon dioxide in it than it has in millions — and possibly tens of millions — of years, according to data released Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and scientists at the University of California San Diego. New data shows that CO2 levels have broken through 430 parts per million, an indication that human-caused global warming will continue to warp the environment.\n\n## Climate Impacts on Ecosystems and Agriculture\n\nIncreasingly severe cyclones, grazing by invasive goats, and persistent turmoil in Yemen have threatened the survival of the country's iconic dragon's blood tree — a species found only on the Yemeni island of Socotra that is now struggling to survive intensifying threats from climate change. The frequency of severe cyclones has increased dramatically across the Arabian Sea in recent decades, according to a 2017 study in the journal Nature Climate Change, and Socotra's dragon's blood trees are paying the price.\n\nBanana crops are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and the devastating effects on its cultivation could begin to manifest in the next 50 years. A report published in May by Christian Aid found that 60% of banana-growing areas are at risk of disappearing within the next five decades due to extreme weather, rising temperatures, and pests. This is particularly concerning as 80% of the world's exports of the fruit originate from Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n## Wildfire and Weather Impacts\n\nMore than 200 wildfires are raging across Canada, sending a thick blanket of choking smoke through the U.S. Midwest. Experts says climate change means U.S. residents better get used to it. The hotter, drying conditions that come with climate change are making these annual fires across North America, and in other parts of the world, the new norm.\n\n## Policy and Financial Responses\n\nA bill to raise the tourist tax to 11% in 2025, increasing to 12% in 2026, has been passed by the Hawaii Senate, with funds to be allocated to climate resilience and economic development initiatives. \"The legislature further finds that given the scale and impact of the climate emergency, the state must invest in bold actions to prepare for, mitigate, and adapt to climate change, including resiliency to intensifying natural disasters,\" according to the bill's text.\n\nIn the battle over how to pay for damage wrought by climate change, California lawmakers had an idea: Create a \"superfund\" that makes big polluters pay. Proposed legislation hasn't moved out of the Assembly and Senate, raising questions about how far California will go in efforts to make oil and gas companies pay for climate damage.\n\nStriking images, exhibited as part of the Right Here, Right Now Global Climate Summit, show the devastating effects of climate change. The summit, held at the University of Oxford in the UK and supported by UN Human Rights (OHCHR), aims to reframe climate change as a human rights crisis and spotlight climate solutions."

While these aren't specifically Reddit discussions (the site:reddit.com operator didn't return results), the search did find comprehensive articles about programming languages trending in 2025. Here's what the sources indicate:\n\n## Top Programming Languages for 2025\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the most recommended programming languages to learn in 2025 are:\n\n### 1. **Python** - The Clear Leader\nPython continues its multi-year domination across all major rankings. The fact Python has all the data science and machine learning libraries makes it more relevant than ever in 2025 with so many companies madly rushing to adopt AI. Python remains the undisputed leader, with a massive +8.72% increase in ratings. It continues to be the go-to language for AI, data science, automation, and web development.\n\n### 2. **Java** - Consistent Runner-Up\nJava has been a consistent entry on our list, remaining in #2 since 2022. Java moved from #4 to #3, with a +1.79% boost. Despite competition from newer languages like Kotlin and Go, Java remains widely used in enterprise software, Android development, and backend systems.\n\n### 3. **JavaScript** - Essential for Web Development\nJavaScript remain strong in the rankings. JavaScript remains in the same positions. JavaScript remains essential for web development.\n\n### 4. **C++** - Rising in Systems Programming\nIf you're in system programming: C++ is overtaking C, making it the better long-term investment. This suggests that while both languages remain important for systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications, developers may prefer C++ due to modern features and better abstractions.\n\n### 5. **Rust** - Growing for Safety and Performance\nRust and Swift are slowly increasing in year-over-year popularity. Rust is a newer language that focuses on safety and speed. It's perfect for building systems that need to be super reliable. Rust is growing fast because it's safe and fast. It's a great language to learn if you want to work on cutting edge projects.\n\n### Other Notable Languages:\n- **Go/Golang**: If you're into cloud and backend engineering: Go is a good option for the future\n- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is like JavaScript but with extra features that make it easier to build big apps. TypeScript is becoming the standard for modern web development. Learning it will make you a better developer\n- **Swift**: Swift are slowly increasing in year-over-year popularity\n- **Kotlin**: Among tech learners on the Pluralsight platform, languages such as Kotlin are very popular, but this is not reflected in industry usage just yet\n- **C#**: C# remains at #5, but it suffered the biggest drop in ratings (-3.41%)\n\n### Key Trends for 2025:\n1. Python, JavaScript, and Java have always been among the top suggestions due to their versatility, as well as job market demand. Other languages, like Go and Rust, gain a lot of prominence owing to their performance coupled with modern features\n\n2. AI and machine learning are driving Python's continued dominance\n\n3. Systems programming is shifting from C to C++\n\n4. Modern languages like Rust and Go are gaining traction for their safety and performance features\n\nThe sources also mention that the Rust community on Reddit is active, and Stack Overflow or Reddit are mentioned as places where developers ask questions and learn from others about programming languages like Kotlin."
